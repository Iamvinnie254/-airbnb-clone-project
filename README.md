## *⚙️ Technology Stack*

###  Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It provides a powerful ORM, authentication system, and structure for developing scalable and secure web applications.

###  Django REST Framework (DRF)
An extension of Django that simplifies building RESTful APIs. It handles serialization, authentication, and CRUD operations, allowing smooth communication between the backend and frontend.

###  GraphQL
A flexible query language that enables clients to request only the data they need. It improves API efficiency and provides a modern alternative to traditional REST endpoints.

###  PostgreSQL
A powerful, open-source relational database used for storing and managing application data. It ensures data consistency, supports complex queries, and integrates seamlessly with Django’s ORM.

### Celery
A task queue used for handling asynchronous processes such as sending notifications, processing payments, or performing background jobs, improving application performance and user experience.

### Redis
An in-memory data store used for caching, session management, and queuing background tasks, ensuring faster response times and optimized database performance.

### Docker
A containerization tool that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated containers, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

###  CI/CD Pipelines
Automated workflows for continuous integration and deployment. They ensure that new changes are tested, validated, and deployed efficiently without manual intervention.

## *✨ Feature Breakdown*

### User Management
Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. This feature ensures secure access control and allows both guests and hosts to manage their personal information, credentials, and roles within the platform.

### Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and manage property listings with essential details such as title, description, location, and price per night. This feature provides guests with accurate and up-to-date information when browsing available accommodations.

###  Booking System
Enables users to book properties, view booking details, and manage reservations efficiently. It ensures that each booking maintains proper availability status while preventing overlapping reservations.

###  Payment Processing
Integrates a secure payment gateway to handle transactions related to property bookings. It tracks payment history, verifies successful transactions, and enhances trust between hosts and guests.

###  Review System
Allows users to post reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This feature fosters transparency and credibility, helping other users make informed booking decisions.

### Data Optimization
Implements indexing, caching, and database optimization techniques to enhance performance. This ensures fast data retrieval, reduced server load, and an overall smoother user experience across the platform.


## *🔒 API Security*

Security is a core component of the Airbnb Clone Project, ensuring that all user interactions, transactions, and data exchanges are protected from unauthorized access or manipulation. The backend implements multiple layers of security to safeguard sensitive information and maintain trust between users, hosts, and the platform.

### Authentication
User authentication is managed using secure token-based methods such as **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**. This ensures that only verified users can access protected endpoints. Authentication prevents unauthorized access and safeguards personal user data such as emails, profiles, and booking details.

###  Authorization
Authorization ensures that users can only access or modify resources they own or have permission for. For example, hosts can edit their property listings while guests can only manage their own bookings. This principle of least privilege prevents data breaches and misuse.

### Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is applied to API endpoints to prevent abuse, such as brute-force login attempts or excessive requests that could lead to denial-of-service attacks. It helps maintain system stability and fair usage for all users.

###  Data Encryption
Sensitive information, including passwords and payment details, is encrypted both in transit (via **HTTPS/SSL**) and at rest. Encryption ensures that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable to unauthorized parties.

###  Secure Payment Processing
All payment transactions are handled through secure, PCI-compliant gateways. This measure ensures the confidentiality and integrity of financial data while preventing fraud and unauthorized access to payment information.

### Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent common security threats such as **SQL injection**, **cross-site scripting (XSS)**, and **command injection**. This ensures that the API only processes clean and expected data.

---

By implementing these measures, the Airbnb Clone Project maintains a strong security posture, protecting users, their data, and the platform’s integrity.
