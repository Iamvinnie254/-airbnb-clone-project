# Airbnb-clone-project

> The Airbnb Clone Project aims to replicate the core functionality of the Airbnb platform by building a robust and scalable backend system that supports user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews. The project is designed to provide a seamless experience for both guests and hosts, ensuring reliability, efficiency, and security in handling operations.

## 🏆 Project Goals

- User Management: Enable secure user registration, authentication, and profile handling.

- Property Management: Allow hosts to create, update, and manage property listings.

- Booking System: Provide users with the ability to book properties, view details, and manage reservations.

- Payment Processing: Integrate a secure system to handle and record payment transactions.

- Review System: Allow guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties.

- Performance Optimization: Implement database indexing, caching, and asynchronous tasks to improve performance and scalability.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Backend Framework: Django

- API Layer: Django REST Framework & GraphQL

- Database: PostgreSQL

- Task Queue: Celery

- Caching & Session Management: Redis

- Containerization: Docker

- CI/CD: Automated testing and deployment pipelines

## 👥 Team Roles

### 🧩 Backend Developer
Responsible for designing and implementing the server-side logic, API endpoints, and integrations. Ensures data flows smoothly between the database, frontend, and external services while maintaining security, scalability, and performance.

### 🗄️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages the design, optimization, and maintenance of the database. Ensures data integrity, applies indexing for faster queries, and oversees backup, recovery, and performance tuning.

### ⚙️ DevOps Engineer
Handles deployment, continuous integration, and infrastructure management. Automates workflows, monitors system performance, and ensures scalability and reliability across environments.

### 💻 Frontend Developer
Builds the user-facing components of the application. Integrates APIs, designs responsive and intuitive interfaces, and ensures a smooth and engaging user experience for both guests and hosts.

### 🧪 QA Engineer (Quality Assurance)
Tests the application to detect and resolve bugs, usability issues, and performance bottlenecks. Validates that all features meet the required functionality and quality standards before release.

### 📋 Project Manager
Coordinates the team’s workflow, manages timelines, and aligns deliverables with project objectives. Facilitates communication between developers, stakeholders, and clients to ensure successful project delivery.


## ⚙️ Technology Stack

### 🐍 Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It provides a powerful ORM, authentication system, and structure for developing scalable and secure web applications.

### 🔗 Django REST Framework (DRF)
An extension of Django that simplifies building RESTful APIs. It handles serialization, authentication, and CRUD operations, allowing smooth communication between the backend and frontend.

### 🧩 GraphQL
A flexible query language that enables clients to request only the data they need. It improves API efficiency and provides a modern alternative to traditional REST endpoints.

### 🐘 PostgreSQL
A powerful, open-source relational database used for storing and managing application data. It ensures data consistency, supports complex queries, and integrates seamlessly with Django’s ORM.

### ⚡ Celery
A task queue used for handling asynchronous processes such as sending notifications, processing payments, or performing background jobs, improving application performance and user experience.

### 🧠 Redis
An in-memory data store used for caching, session management, and queuing background tasks, ensuring faster response times and optimized database performance.

### 🐳 Docker
A containerization tool that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated containers, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipelines
Automated workflows for continuous integration and deployment. They ensure that new changes are tested, validated, and deployed efficiently without manual intervention.
