## ⚙️ Technology Stack

### 🐍 Django
A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It provides a powerful ORM, authentication system, and structure for developing scalable and secure web applications.

### 🔗 Django REST Framework (DRF)
An extension of Django that simplifies building RESTful APIs. It handles serialization, authentication, and CRUD operations, allowing smooth communication between the backend and frontend.

### 🧩 GraphQL
A flexible query language that enables clients to request only the data they need. It improves API efficiency and provides a modern alternative to traditional REST endpoints.

### 🐘 PostgreSQL
A powerful, open-source relational database used for storing and managing application data. It ensures data consistency, supports complex queries, and integrates seamlessly with Django’s ORM.

### ⚡ Celery
A task queue used for handling asynchronous processes such as sending notifications, processing payments, or performing background jobs, improving application performance and user experience.

### 🧠 Redis
An in-memory data store used for caching, session management, and queuing background tasks, ensuring faster response times and optimized database performance.

### 🐳 Docker
A containerization tool that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated containers, ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipelines
Automated workflows for continuous integration and deployment. They ensure that new changes are tested, validated, and deployed efficiently without manual intervention.
